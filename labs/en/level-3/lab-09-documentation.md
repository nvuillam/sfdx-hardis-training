# Lab 9 - Generate the project documentation

**Level**: 3 Release Manager
**Time**: ~30 min
**You will**: produce readable documentation of an org nobody has documented in two years, from the
sources you already have.

## The situation

Sofia knew this org. Sofia has left.

What exists: two years of metadata in a git repository. What does not exist: any description of what
the objects are for, how the flows relate, or why the scheduler behaves the way it does.

You are not going to write that by hand. Most of it can be generated, and the part that cannot is
exactly the part worth a person's time.

## Before you start

- [ ] Lab 8 finished
- [ ] The repository up to date on `integration`

## Steps

### 1. Open the Documentation Workbench

![The Documentation Workbench, with the parts to include, the Generate button and the deploy targets](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/documentation-workbench--generate-and-deploy.png)

Everything in this lab happens on this one screen. Three parts of it matter:

1. **Include** **(1)**, which decides what gets documented. Objects, flows, Apex, permissions and
   packages are all ticked, which is what you want the first time
2. **Generate Documentation** **(2)**, the button that produces the pages
3. **Deploy Documentation** **(3)**, at the bottom, which publishes them

### 2. Generate

Click **Generate Documentation** **(2)**. It reads the sources in `force-app/` and produces a set of
markdown pages under `docs/`.

It takes a few minutes on a small project like Helios.

### 3. Read what it produced

Four kinds of page, and they are worth knowing apart:

| Page                          | What it contains                                                                                                | Who reads it                                                              |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Object pages**              | Every field with its type, description and help text, the validation rules, the record types, the relationships | An admin asked to change something                                        |
| **Flow pages**                | A readable diagram of each flow, plus its entry conditions and elements                                         | Anybody who has to understand automation without opening the Flow Builder |
| **Apex pages**                | Classes, their methods, their ApexDoc                                                                           | A developer                                                               |
| **Package and profile pages** | What is installed, what the permission sets grant                                                               | An audit                                                                  |

Open `docs/objects/Installation__c.md`. Every field you and your teammates created across three
levels is there, with the descriptions you wrote in Setup.

**Fields with no description produce a row with a blank cell.** That is the honest output, and it is
the argument for the two seconds it takes to fill them in. Look at how many blanks your org has.

### 4. Look at the flow diagrams

Open the page for `Installation_Assign_Crew`.

The flow is rendered as a Mermaid diagram: the trigger, the entry conditions, the decisions and
their outcomes. It is readable by somebody who has never opened a Salesforce flow, which is most of
the people who will ask you what it does.

There is a second thing worth noticing: the history diagrams show how a flow changed over time,
built from git history. That answers "when did this flow start doing that", which is otherwise a
long afternoon.

### 5. Fix the worst gaps by hand

Generated documentation tells you **what** the org contains. It cannot tell you **why**.

Spend fifteen minutes adding what only a person can:

1. A paragraph at the top of the Installation page saying what an installation is in the business
2. One sentence on the scheduler explaining the preparation buffer, which looks arbitrary in code
3. A note on the crew capacity cap saying it is a safety rule, not a cost rule

Those three paragraphs are worth more than the other forty pages, and they are the reason this lab
exists at the end of a level rather than at the start.

### 6. Publish it

The **Deploy Documentation** section **(3)** offers three targets:

- **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages** publishes it as a site, the way the sfdx-hardis documentation
  itself is published
- **Deploy to Confluence** publishes it into a Confluence space, and needs a Confluence API token
  configured first
- **Deploy to Salesforce** builds the HTML and uploads it as a static resource, with a Visualforce
  page and a custom tab, so the documentation is reachable from inside Salesforce. It is capped by
  the 5 MB static resource limit, so it suits a small project

For this lab, generate and commit. Publishing is a project decision.

Commit the `docs/` folder on `integration` through an ordinary Pull Request.

### 7. Make it a habit, not an event

Documentation generated once is out of date in a month. The generation is a command, so it can run
on a schedule the way the monitoring does.

Add a line in `MY-PIPELINE.md` saying when it runs and where it is published.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: what reads what</summary>

The command was:

    sf hardis:doc:project2markdown

which reads:

- `force-app/` for the metadata: objects, fields, flows, Apex, permission sets, packages
- `manifest/package.xml` for what is in scope
- `config/.sfdx-hardis.yml` for the project configuration it documents
- the **git history**, for the "what changed and when" diagrams

and writes markdown under `docs/`, plus a `mkdocs.yml` so the result is a site rather than a pile of
files.

The flow diagrams are Mermaid, generated from the flow XML. That means they are text in the
repository, so they diff, review and version like everything else, and they never go stale relative
to the flow they describe.

Two related commands worth knowing:

- `sf hardis:doc:override-prompts` lets a project override the AI prompts used when descriptions are
  generated rather than read
- `sf hardis:doc:plugin:generate` is what generates the sfdx-hardis documentation itself, which is a
  reasonable existence proof that the output is readable

If the project has an AI provider configured, the generator can also write the missing descriptions
rather than leaving blanks. Useful, and not a substitute for the three paragraphs in step 5: a model
can describe what a field is, not why the business needs it.

</details>

## What you should see

- A `docs/` folder with object, flow and Apex pages
- `docs/objects/Installation__c.md` listing every field from all three levels
- A readable diagram of `Installation_Assign_Crew`
- Three paragraphs you wrote yourself
- The whole thing committed through a Pull Request

## If it goes wrong

**The generation fails on a flow.**
A flow with an unusual element can trip the diagram generator. The page is still produced without
the diagram. Report it as an issue on sfdx-hardis if you hit one.

**The object pages are almost empty.**
The sources are there but the descriptions are not. That is the org, not the tool.

**The docs folder is enormous and the Pull Request is unreviewable.**
Expected the first time. Say so in the Pull Request description. Subsequent regenerations produce
small diffs.
