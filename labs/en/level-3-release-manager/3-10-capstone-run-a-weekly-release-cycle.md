# Lab 3.10 - Capstone: run a weekly release cycle

**Level**: 3 Release Manager

**Time**: ~45 min

**You will**: do a whole week in one sitting, with no step-by-step, and end with something you could
show somebody.

## The situation

Monday morning. Two Pull Requests are waiting, the business expects a release on Thursday, and
nobody is going to tell you the order to do things in.

## Before you start

- [ ] Labs 3.1 to 3.9 finished
- [ ] All four pipeline orgs working, all four branches deploying

## The week

### Monday: take in what contributors sent you

Two Pull Requests wait. **US-020**, open since Lab 3.4 and still failing. And a new one from Romain:
**Training: Level 3** > **Simulate my teammates**, and pick **US-055 Install Date says which day it
means**.

![The Level 3 training menu on the Welcome page](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/welcome-custom-menu-3.png)

For each of the two:

- Read the sfdx-hardis comment
- Read the diff with the four questions from Lab 3.2: does it match the story, does anything
  disappear, are permissions on a permission set, is it reversible
- Merge it or send it back with a comment, and say why

US-020 still fails its check. It stays with its author, with the failure named. Do not fix it
yourself: you review and merge what contributors send, and you do not write it for them.

### Tuesday: merge and deploy to integration

Merge what is ready, in an order you can justify. Watch the deployment, read what it sent and what
it skipped, and check the org afterwards.

### Wednesday: promote to UAT

Create the promotion from `integration` into `uat`. Read the deployment actions it carries **before**
merging, and do the manual steps afterwards.

Verify in `helios-uat` that the stories are usable, not only deployed.

### Thursday: release to production

Promote `uat` into `preprod` first, and check `helios-preprod` behaves. Then create the promotion from
`preprod` into `main`. Read the counts line in the sfdx-hardis comment and stop if anything is being
deleted that you were not expecting. Merge, watch, verify, do the manual steps.

This release is also what finally carries the Lab 3.7 retrofit into `main`, so the `Needs Reinspection`
picklist value reaches production through the pipeline and the check for Lab 3.7 passes.

Then generate the release notes of the release to `main`, add the sentence at the top that says what
this release is for, and put them in the description of the Pull Request from `preprod` into
`main`, the way Lab 3.5 did for `uat`.

### Friday: measure

Set `helios-prod` as your default org in **Orgs Manager**, so the report measures production rather
than your sandbox, then run the DORA report and compare it with the baseline you took in Lab 3.6.

Then read back over the week, and answer three questions for yourself, the ones a successor would
ask:

- What went out this week, and where are its release notes? In the description of the release Pull
  Request
- What did not, and why? US-020, sent back with its failure named
- What did you have to do by hand? Every manual step is a candidate for a deployment action next
  time

## What makes this the capstone

Nothing here is new. Every step is a lab you have done. What is new is that **nobody told you the
order**, and the order is the job.

Three decisions you had to make without a lab telling you:

1. Which Pull Requests go into this release and which wait
2. Whether the failing one blocks the release
3. Whether the manual steps are acceptable, or whether the release waits until somebody automates
   them

Those three are what a release manager is for. The tooling handles everything else, which is the
point of having it.

## What you should see

- Two Pull Requests reviewed, one merged, one sent back with a reason
- `integration`, `uat`, `preprod` and `main` all carrying the release, in that order, each through
  its own deployment
- Release notes in the description of the release Pull Request, with a human sentence at the top
- A second DORA report to compare with the baseline of Lab 3.6

## If it goes wrong

**A check fails and names a lab you are sure you did.**
Read what it says it looked for. The checks assert outcomes on the `integration` branch, not effort:
a story built in your org but never merged does not count, and neither does one merged into a branch
that is not `integration`.

**The Lab 3.7 check wants `Needs Reinspection` on `main`.**
That is check `3.8`, and at the end of the level it looks at `main`, not `integration`. The hotfix is
there since Lab 3.7; the retrofit only went to `integration`. Thursday is what satisfies it: the
release that takes the week's work to production carries the retrofit with it. If you have not run
Thursday yet, run it.

**A teammate simulation says there is nothing to commit.**
That story is already merged. Each teammate story merges once per level, and the ones Level 3 uses
are listed in each lab. Nothing is wrong: move on.

**A deployment is green and the feature is not in the org.**
Open the log and find **Listing Post-deployment actions**. If it says none were defined, the actions
never ran, and Lab 2.4 explains what to do about it. A green job proves the metadata went in
and nothing else.

**The whole thing is too much to finish in one sitting.**
It is meant to be a week. Stop at the end of any day: each one ends with something merged, and
nothing carries an unfinished state into the next.

## Check your work

Welcome page > **Training: Level 3** > **Check my work**, then pick **Everything in level 3**.

Eleven checks.

## Claim your badge

Welcome page > **Training: Level 3** > **Claim my badge**.

A Level 3 claim re-runs the **Level 1 and Level 2 audits first**. That is how the prerequisite is
enforced, because a Trailmix cannot gate anything. The command runs those same audits on your
machine before it opens anything, so you find out here rather than on the issue.

!!! tip "If the course helped you"
    [hardisgroupcom/vscode-sfdx-hardis](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/vscode-sfdx-hardis) is the
    extension every click of this course went through. A star is how an open source project stays
    visible. It is up to you: the badge does not depend on it.

The badge is **sfdx-hardis Release Manager**.

## What to do with all this

Three things worth doing in the week after you finish, in order of usefulness:

**One: take the setup checklist to your own project.** The
[setup checklist](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-devops-setup-checklist/) is the list
of everything a real pipeline needs. You have now done most of it once. Go through it against
whatever project you actually work on and count what is missing.

**Two: delete your training orgs, or keep them deliberately.** The scratch orgs delete themselves
after 30 days. The two Developer Edition orgs holding a fictional solar company are fine to keep as a
place to try things, and `helios-prod` stays a Dev Hub you can create scratch orgs from. If you keep
them, delete the `SFDX_AUTH_URL_INTEGRATION` and `SFDX_AUTH_URL_UAT` secrets if they are somehow
still there, and remember the JWT certificates in your fork (your own copy of the course repository on GitHub, for example `github.com/my-username/sfdx-hardis-training`) are real credentials to real orgs.

**Three: the promotion branches feature.** Everything you did promotes **everything waiting** from
one branch to the next. Some teams need to promote a subset. That is what
[promotion branches](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/salesforce-devops-promotion-branches/) are
for, it is experimental, and it will make sense to you now in a way it would not have three levels
ago.

## Thank you

If a lab was unclear, wrong, or assumed something it should not have, say so: open an issue on the
training repository. The labs that are hardest to follow are usually the ones nobody reported.
