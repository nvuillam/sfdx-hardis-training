# Lab 2.9 - Capstone: deliver a User Story that has it all

**Level**: 2 Contributor advanced

**Time**: ~30 min

**You will**: deliver one story that contains a dependency to check, a data deployment action and a
teammate working on the same permission set, with no step-by-step.

## The situation

> **US-041 - Installation handover checklist**
>
> As a planner, I want a handover checklist on the installation with its reference items, so that a
> job is only closed when the checklist is complete.
>
> Acceptance criteria:
>
> - A `Handover_Item__c` object exists, child of Installation
> - 10 reference checklist items are loaded in every org
> - The close flow blocks on an incomplete checklist

Three of the situations you met separately are waiting in this one story. You already know how to
handle all three.

## Before you start

- [ ] Labs 2.1 to 2.8 finished and merged
- [ ] `helios-dev` level with `integration`

## What to do

### The story

1. **Take it.** Name `US-041-handover-checklist`, org `helios-dev`
2. **Build the object**: `Handover_Item__c`, with `External_Id__c` (Text 40, external id, unique),
   `Installation__c` (lookup), `Label__c`, `Sequence__c`, `Is_Done__c`, `Is_Template__c`
3. **Build the reference data**: 10 template `Handover_Item__c` records with no installation, the
   checklist every job starts from
4. **Build the close check**: a record-triggered flow `Installation_Close_Check` on Installation
   that blocks a save into `Completed` while any related handover item is not done. Describe every
   element, the way Lab 2.2 had you do
5. **Grant the new object and its fields** on the `Helios Delivery Manager` permission set, never
   on a Profile, the way Lab 2.6 had you do: **Read**, **Create** and **Edit** on Handover Item, and
   **Read** and **Edit** on its fields. The pipeline's user holds that permission set too, and the
   data load of the second trap needs it, as in Lab 2.4
6. **Bring it down**: **Commit changes**, **Recent Changes**, and take what you made and nothing
   else. Commit it
7. **Publish, Pull Request, green, merge**

### The three things waiting for you

**One: the dependency.** Do not assume every field you created reached the repository. Count them in
`force-app/` and count them again in the **Git Delta package.xml** report before you push. When one is missing,
the cause is the file at the root of the repository you met in Lab 2.2, and the deployment error you
get three steps later will name the field and not the cause. Do not guess: look.

**Two: the data.** Ten records in your org are ten records in your org. A green deployment will put
the object and the flow into `helios-integration` and the checklist will be empty there, and the
feature will do nothing at all. Build a data workspace and declare an action.

**Three: the teammate on the same file.** Before you open your Pull Request, run **Training:
Level 2 > Simulate my teammates** and pick **US-019**, then merge it. Amina adds a quote PDF field
and grants it on `Helios Delivery Manager`, the same permission set your checklist needs. Bring
`integration` into your branch from the **Source Control** panel.

This time git merges it on its own, with no conflict: Salesforce keeps the permissions of a
permission set in alphabetical order, so her `Panel_Batch__c` grant and your `Handover_Item__c`
ones land far apart in the file. **A clean merge is not proof.** Open the permission set and find
both, `Panel_Batch__c.Quote_Pdf_Url__c` and your `Handover_Item__c` fields, before you publish. A
merge that git did alone and nobody read is how a grant goes missing without a conflict to warn
anybody.

!!! note "Not US-018 again"
    Lab 2.7 already merged US-018, so simulating it a second time reports nothing to commit. Each
    teammate story merges once per level.

**And the data action.** Declare it the way Lab 2.4 did: the Pull Request has to exist first, so
publish, open it, then add the **Data** action on its **Deployment Actions** tab, **Deployment job
only**, commit the file the editor wrote and publish again.

### A hint on sequencing, because getting this wrong costs an hour

The reference records need the object to exist before they can be loaded. So:

- The object and the flow deploy as metadata
- The data action runs **after** the deployment, not before

That is the opposite of Lab 2.3, where the backfill had to run first. The rule is not "always before"
or "always after": it is **what does this action need to already exist?**

## What you should see

In `helios-integration`, after the merge:

- `Handover_Item__c` with 10 template records
- Saving an installation to `Completed` with an incomplete checklist is refused, with your message
- `Helios_Delivery_Manager` granting the new fields, and Amina's quote PDF field still present

## If it goes wrong

Everything you need is in Labs 2.2, 2.4 and 2.7. Look up the one step you are stuck on rather than
rereading the labs.

**Training: Level 2 > Reset this level** if the repository gets away from you. It resets to the start of
Level 2, which means redoing the capstone, not the whole level.

## Check your work

Welcome page > **Training: Level 2** > **Check my work**, then pick **Everything in level 2**.

Nine checks.

## Claim your badge

Welcome page > **Training: Level 2** > **Claim my badge**.

Same as Level 1: it re-checks everything here, opens the claim form filled in, and you tick the
three boxes and submit.

A Level 2 claim re-runs the **Level 1 audit as well**, because the badge says you can do both. If
you skipped Level 1, that is where it will say so, and the command says it before the form opens.

!!! info "It also asks you to star MegaLinter"
    Level 2 asks you to star [oxsecurity/megalinter](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter), the
    linting engine behind the quality gate your Pull Requests go through, on top of the Level 1 star.
    The command offers to do both for you, and the audit checks them.

The badge for this level is called **sfdx-hardis Contributor**, without a qualifier. That is
deliberate: Level 1 makes you able to deliver, Level 2 makes you a contributor.

## What comes next

You can stop here and be genuinely good at the contributor job.

Level 3 is a different role. You stop asking for your work to be merged and start deciding what
gets merged, when it is released, and what happens when production breaks at 17:40 on a Friday.

The project you have been contributing to stops at `integration`: no UAT, no production, no proper
CI authentication, no monitoring. Level 3 is finishing it.
