# Installation__c

An installation is one solar job at one customer site: the panels, the crew that fits them and the
day they go on the roof. The crew capacity cap is a safety rule, not a cost rule: too many people on
a small roof get in each other's way.

A crew larger than the installation cap is brought back down to the cap: too many people on a small roof is a safety problem. | Active |
